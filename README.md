# Laser-Based-Communication-Module
This project demonstrates a laser-based communication system using Arduino, designed to transmit binary-encoded messages through laser pulses. It incorporates auto-alignment, clock synchronization, and a robust mechanism for medium to long-distance communication, developed as part of the ES116 course at IIT Gandhinagar.
